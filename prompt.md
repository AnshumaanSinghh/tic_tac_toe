#  **SUPER PROMPT: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Python Game**

---

## **DIMENSION 1  \- CONTEXT AND ROLE**

You are a **Senior Python Game Developer and UI/UX Engineer** with deep expertise in building production quality desktop applications using Python's `tkinter` GUI framework. You specialize in crafting immersive, visually stunning game experiences that feel modern and polished  \- not like typical academic exercises. Your work bridges the gap between clean software architecture and delightful user experience.

You are tasked with designing and implementing a **complete, single file Python Tic Tac Toe game** that meets production level standards in code quality, visual design, user interaction, and intelligent gameplay. The game must feel like a premium desktop application  \- not a beginner's project.

The final deliverable must be a **single `.py` file** that can be run directly with no external dependencies beyond Python's standard library. It must be portable, self contained, and immediately playable by any user with Python 3.8+ installed.

---

## **DIMENSION 2  \- OBJECTIVE**

Develop a complete, full featured Tic Tac Toe desktop game that achieves all of the following goals simultaneously:

1. **Implements a beautiful, modern dark themed GUI** using `tkinter` with `Canvas` based rendering, custom colors, hover effects, and smooth visual feedback.  
2. **Supports two game modes**: Player vs. AI and Player vs. Player (2 humans on the same machine).  
3. **Includes an unbeatable AI opponent** built using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning**, with selectable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
4. **Tracks scores persistently** across rounds within the session, displaying live score updates with animated feedback.  
5. **Provides animated move placement**, cell highlighting on win, turn indicators, and status messages throughout gameplay.  
6. **Implements robust game state management** with clean separation between UI rendering, game logic, and AI computation.  
7. **Delivers graceful error handling** for edge cases: clicking occupied cells, interacting during AI thinking time, restarting mid game, and resetting scores.

The game should feel complete, satisfying, and replayable. Every interaction  \- from hovering over a cell to a winning animation  \- should feel intentional and polished.

## **DIMENSION 3  \- UI AND VISUAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS**

### **Color System and Theme**

The game must implement a **professional dark color palette** with carefully chosen accent colors:

* **Background**: Deep navy (`#1a1a2e`)  \- the primary canvas background  
* **Card/Panel surface**: Slightly lighter navy (`#16213e`)  \- for framed sections  
* **Accent/Interactive**: Rich indigo blue (`#0f3460`)  \- for borders, hover states, cell fills  
* **Player X color**: Vibrant coral red (`#e94560`)  \- consistently used for all X markers and labels  
* **Player O / AI color**: Electric cyan (`#00b4d8`)  \- consistently used for O markers and labels  
* **Win highlight**: Gold (`#ffd700`)  \- used on winning cells to draw attention  
* **Success / Active**: Teal green (`#4ecca3`)  \- for start buttons and positive confirmations  
* **Primary text**: Pure white (`#ffffff`)  
* **Secondary text**: Muted lavender (`#a8b2d8`)  \- for labels and less critical information

All colors must be applied **consistently** throughout every UI component.

### **Animation Requirements**

Implement the following animation behaviors:

* **Marker placement animation**: When X or O is placed, animate the font size from small → large → slightly smaller → settled (a "pop in" bounce effect using `root.after()` scheduling, no external libraries).  
* **Hover effects**: When a user hovers over an empty cell, the background transitions to the accent color. On leave, it reverts.  
* **Win highlight animation**: The three winning cells must switch to gold background instantly upon game end, with text inverting to dark for contrast.  
* **AI thinking delay**: A deliberate 400ms delay before the AI places its marker (using `root.after`), during which the turn label reads "AI is thinking..."  \- giving the illusion of thought.  
* **Score increment feedback**: Score labels must visually update immediately after each round ends.

### **Layout Structure**

The window must be fixed at **520×720 pixels** and include these stacked sections top to bottom:

1. **Title Bar**  \- "TIC TAC TOE" in large bold font, with subtitle "ULTIMATE EDITION" in small spaced caps  
2. **Mode Selector Panel**  \- Toggle buttons for "vs AI" and "2 Players" with active state highlighted  
3. **Difficulty Selector**  \- Radio buttons for Easy / Medium / Hard (visible only in AI mode)  
4. **Scoreboard**  \- Three columns: Player X score | Draws | Player O / AI score, each color coded  
5. **Turn Indicator Label**  \- Dynamic label showing whose turn it is, color coded to the player  
6. **Game Board Canvas**  \- 360×360 pixel canvas with a 3×3 grid rendered via lines and Canvas items  
7. **Status Label**  \- Shows contextual messages: "Game in progress", "Player X Wins\!", "It's a Draw\!"  
8. **Control Buttons**  \- "START GAME" / "PLAY AGAIN" and "RESET SCORES" buttons

---

## **DIMENSION 4  \- GAME BOARD AND INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Board Rendering**

The game board must be rendered entirely on a **`tk.Canvas` widget**  \- not using `tk.Button` grid layout. This gives full control over:

* Custom cell hover states via canvas rectangle fills  
* Text items for markers with animated font resizing  
* Win highlight overlays via rectangle color changes  
* Clean line based grid separators

Each cell must be both a rectangle item and a text item, both bound to the same click handler via `canvas.tag_bind()`.

### **Cell Interaction Rules**

* Clicking an occupied cell must be silently ignored (no error, no feedback)  
* Clicking any cell during AI's turn must be silently ignored  
* Clicking any cell when no game is active (before START) must be silently ignored  
* All three cases handled via a single guard at the top of the move handler

### **Player Move Flow**

User clicks cell → Guard checks (active? empty? human turn?) → place\_marker() →  
animate\_marker() → check\_winner() → if no winner: switch player → update\_turn\_label() →  
if AI mode and AI's turn: root.after(400, ai\_move)

### **AI Move Flow**

ai\_move() called after 400ms → select move based on difficulty →  
place\_marker() → animate\_marker() → check\_winner() → if no winner: switch to Player X → update\_turn\_label()

## **DIMENSION 5  \- AI ENGINE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Architecture**

The AI system must implement three difficulty tiers using a shared codebase:

**Easy Mode**: The AI selects a completely random empty cell. No strategy. Beatable by any player.

**Medium Mode**: The AI uses a probabilistic blend  \- 60% of the time it plays the optimal Minimax move, 40% of the time it picks randomly. This creates a challenging but imperfect opponent.

**Hard Mode**: The AI runs **full Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning**, making it mathematically unbeatable. The best a human can achieve is a draw with perfect play.

### **Minimax Algorithm Specification**

minimax(board, depth, is\_maximizing, alpha, beta):  
    check terminal state → return score (10 depth for AI win, depth 10 for player win, 0 for draw)  
    if maximizing (AI):  
        iterate empty cells, recurse as minimizing, track max score  
        apply alpha pruning  
    if minimizing (Player):  
        iterate empty cells, recurse as maximizing, track min score  
        apply beta pruning  
    return best score

The depth adjustment (`10   depth` and `depth   10`) ensures the AI prefers **faster wins** and **slower losses**, producing more natural feeling gameplay even in Hard mode.

The AI always plays as `PLAYER_O`. The scoring convention:

* AI wins: positive score (higher \= faster win preferred)  
* Player wins: negative score (lower \= faster loss avoided)  
* Draw: 0

### **get\_best\_move() Logic**

Iterate all 9 cells. For each empty cell: temporarily place the AI marker, run minimax, undo the move, track the highest scoring move. Return the index of the best move.

---

## **DIMENSION 6  \- GAME STATE AND DATA MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **State Variables**

Maintain the following state within the main game class:

| Variable | Type | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `board` | `list[str]` (len 9\) | Current board state, each cell is `""`, `"X"`, or `"O"` |
| `current_player` | `str` | `"X"` or `"O"`  \- whose turn it is |
| `game_mode` | `tk.StringVar` | `"ai"` or `"human"` |
| `ai_difficulty` | `tk.StringVar` | `"easy"`, `"medium"`, or `"hard"` |
| `game_active` | `bool` | Whether the game is currently in play |
| `scores` | `dict` | `{X: int, O: int, draws: int}` persisted across rounds |
| `buttons` | `list` | Canvas rectangle item IDs for each cell |
| `cell_texts` | `list` | Canvas text item IDs for each cell |

### **Win Detection**

Check all 8 winning combinations after every move:

* 3 rows: `[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]`  
* 3 columns: `[0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8]`  
* 2 diagonals: `[0,4,8], [2,4,6]`

If a winner is found: call `highlight_win(combo, winner)` → `game_over(winner)`.  
 If no empty cells remain and no winner: `game_over(None)` (draw).

### **Game Reset Behavior**

`start_game()` must:

* Reset `board` to 9 empty strings  
* Set `current_player` to `PLAYER_X`  
* Set `game_active = True`  
* Clear all canvas text items and cell background colors  
* Redraw the grid lines  
* Update turn label  
* Update start button text to "PLAY AGAIN"

`reset_scores()` must reset the `scores` dict, update all score labels, and optionally auto start a new game.

## **DIMENSION 7  \- ARCHITECTURE, CODE QUALITY, AND DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Architecture Pattern**

Implement the entire game as a **single class `TicTacToe`** with clear method responsibility separation:

TicTacToe  
├── \_\_init\_\_()              → Initialize state and launch UI  
├── setup\_ui()              → Build all widgets and layout  
├── draw\_board\_lines()      → Canvas grid rendering  
├── create\_cell\_buttons()   → Canvas cell items \+ event bindings  
├── set\_mode(mode)          → Toggle game mode, update UI  
├── start\_game()            → Reset and begin a new round  
├── make\_move(idx)          → Handle human player clicks  
├── place\_marker(idx, p)    → Update board \+ canvas  
├── animate\_marker(idx)     → Bounce in font animation  
├── hover\_enter/leave(idx)  → Cell hover effects  
├── ai\_move()               → Trigger AI decision  
├── get\_random\_move()       → Easy AI  
├── get\_best\_move()         → Hard AI (calls minimax)  
├── minimax(...)            → Alpha beta pruning engine  
├── check\_winner()          → Game state evaluation (modifies UI)  
├── check\_winner\_board(b)   → Pure function used by minimax  
├── highlight\_win(combo, w) → Gold cell highlight on win  
├── game\_over(winner)       → End state: scores, labels  
├── update\_turn\_label()     → Dynamic turn/thinking indicator  
└── reset\_scores()          → Session score reset

### **Code Quality Standards**

* All methods must have single, clearly defined responsibilities  
* No global variables  \- all state lives in `self`  
* Canvas tag naming convention: `f"cell{i}"` and `f"text{i}"` for all 9 cells  
* Colors defined once in a `self.colors` dictionary  \- never hardcoded inline  
* Event bindings via `canvas.tag_bind()` using lambda with default argument capture (`idx=i`)  
* AI computation must use the pure function `check_winner_board(board)`  \- never the UI coupled `check_winner()`

### **Single File Deliverable Requirements**

The final output must be:

* **One `.py` file**  \- zero external dependencies, zero pip installs required  
* Runnable via: `python tictactoe.py`  
* Compatible with Python 3.8+  
* Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (tkinter is included in standard Python distributions)  
* No imports beyond: `tkinter`, `math`, `random` (all standard library)

### **Error Handling and Edge Cases**

Handle all of the following gracefully (silent guard, no crash, no error dialog):

* Click on occupied cell during active game  
* Click during AI's turn (400ms delay window)  
* Click when game has not been started  
* Mode/difficulty change while a game is in progress (apply on next game start)  
* Rapid repeated clicks on the Start button
